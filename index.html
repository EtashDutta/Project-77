            A console is the combination of a monitor and keyboard. It is a rudimentary interface in which the monitor provides the output and the keyboard is used for input. While any computer with a monitor and keyboard may be considered a console, the term most often refers to a system used to control one or more servers.

        <h3>
            There is actually a way to paste something using the keyboard, but it's not terribly convenient to use. What you'll have to do is use the Alt+Space keyboard combination to bring up the window menu, then hit the E key, and then the P key. This will trigger the menus and paste into the console.
